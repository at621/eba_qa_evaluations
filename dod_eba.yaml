  subject_matter: Counting of days past due in factoring arrangements
  question: |
    As for non-recourse factoring, is it correct to start the counting of days past due
    based on the payment schedule defined or implied in the contractual terms with the client
    (i.e., the party from which the factor purchases the receivables)?
  background: |
    The question is raised as the same has become particularly relevant for a number
    of financial institutions operating in the factoring sector, whereby an incorrect initiation
    of the counting of past due may lead to a misclassification of the relevant exposures which,
    in turn, could cause an overly burdensome effect for financial institutions in terms of
    prudential capital requirements (also in instances which are not characterized by actual or
    potential credit risk deterioration).
  context: |
    Not applicable
  answer: |
    This question has been rejected because the issue it deals with is already explained
    or addressed in Guidelines on the application of the definition of default under Article 178
    of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 (EBA/GL/2016/07).

  subject_matter: Calculation of NPV loss in case of (internal) refinancing
  question: |
    Which NPV loss should be taken in order to calculate the NPV loss if the 1%
    threshold is breached and the forborne loan contract should be placed in default?
  background: |
    A client contacts the institution for a loan restructuring of his retail mortgage loan
    as his repayment capacity has declined. This restructuring is granted via a (internal)
    refinancing of the mortgage loan with a prolongment of the duration and at current market
    interest rate (which is in line with the interest rates granted under normal circumstances and
    taking into account the prolonged duration of the loan). The new interest rate of the refinanced
    loan contract is hereby lower than the interest rate of the original loan contract, but this is due
    to the market evolution of the interest rate levels.
  context: |
    paragraph 49 of EBA/GL/2016/07 >>> For the purposes of unlikeliness to pay as referred to in point (d) of Article 178(3) of
    Regulation (EU) No 575/2013, a distressed restructuring should be considered to have
    occurred when concessions have been extended towards a debtor facing or about to face
    difficulties in meeting its financial commitments as specified in paragraphs 163-167 and 172-
    174 of Annex V Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) No 680/2014 of 16 April 20143 as
    amended by Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) 2015/2274

    paragraph 51 of EBA/GL/2016/07 >>> Institutions should set a threshold for the diminished financial 
    obligation that is considered to be caused by material forgiveness or postponement of principal, interest, 
    or fees, and which should be calculated according to the following formula, and should not be higher than 1%:
    
    𝐷0 = (NPV0 − NPV1) / NPV0
    where:
    DO is diminished financial obligation;
    NPV0 is net present value of cash flows (including unpaid interest and fees) expected
    under contractual obligations before the changes in terms and conditions of the contract
    discounted using the customer’s original effective interest rate;
    NPV1 is net present value of the cash flows expected based on the new arrangement
    discounted using the customer’s original effective interest rate.
  answer: |
    According to paragraph 51 of EBA/GL/2016/07 for the purposes of calculating the
    diminished financial obligation (DO) the parameter NPV1 is to be determined as "the net
    present value of the cash flows expected based on the new arrangement discounted using the
    customer’s original effective interest rate". This rule does not differentiate by the reasons why
    the net present value of the expected cash flows under the new arrangement may be lower.
    Therefore, in the specific case of distressed restructuring as set out in paragraph 49 of
    EBA/GL/2016/07 the institution must determine whether "material forgiveness or postponement
    of principal, interest or fees" (paragraph 51 ibid) has occurred based on the expected cash
    flows under the new arrangement, irrespective of whether these cash flows relate to general
    market rates that are lower than the corresponding market rates underlying the contractual
    obligations before the changes in terms and conditions of the contract, or not.

  subject_matter: Treatment of cured defaulted exposures
  question: |
    For the treatment of cured defaulted exposures, a probation period of 90 days with no
    default triggers must apply before the exposure is moved back to a non-defaulted status.
    According to Article 178(1)(b CRR) default shall be considered to have occurred with regard to
    a particular obligor when the obligor is more than 90 days past due on any material credit
    obligation. However, if the material arrears fall below the thresholds, the arrears counter will
    reset to 0. Should the probation period of 90 days with no default triggers apply before the
    exposure is moved back to a non-defaulted status?
  background: |
    A probation period of 90 days must be met since the day a default exposure
    does not meet any default criteria triggers.
  context: |
    Source 1: CRR Article 178 > Default of an obligor

    1. A default shall be considered to have occurred with regard to a particular obligor when either or 
    both of the following have taken place:
    (a) the institution considers that the obligor is unlikely to pay its credit obligations to the institution, 
    the parent undertaking or any of its subsidiaries in full, without recourse by the institution to actions 
    such as realising security;
    (b) the obligor is past due more than 90 days on any material credit obligation to the institution, the 
    parent undertaking or any of its subsidiaries. Competent authorities may replace the 90 days with 180 days 
    for exposures secured by residential or SME commercial real estate in the retail exposure class, as well as 
    exposures to public sector entities). The 180 days shall not apply for the purposes of Article 127.

    In the case of retail exposures, institutions may apply the definition of default laid down in points (a) 
    and (b) of the first subparagraph at the level of an individual credit facility rather than in relation to 
    the total obligations of a borrower.

    2. The following shall apply for the purposes of point (b) of paragraph 1:
    (a) for overdrafts, days past due commence once an obligor has breached an advised limit, has been advised 
    a limit smaller than current outstandings, or has drawn credit without authorisation and the underlying 
    amount is material;
    (b) for the purposes of point (a), an advised limit comprises any credit limit determined by the institution 
    and about which the obligor has been informed by the institution;
    (c) days past due for credit cards commence on the minimum payment due date;
    (d) materiality of a credit obligation past due shall be assessed against a threshold, defined by the 
    competent authorities. This threshold shall reflect a level of risk that the competent authority considers 
    to be reasonable;
    (e) institutions shall have documented policies in respect of the counting of days past due, in particular 
    in respect of the re-ageing of the facilities and the granting of extensions, amendments or deferrals, 
    renewals, and netting of existing accounts. These policies shall be applied consistently over time, and 
    shall be in line with the internal risk management and decision processes of the institution.

    3. For the purpose of point (a) of paragraph 1, elements to be taken as indications of unlikeliness to 
    pay shall include the following:
    (a) the institution puts the credit obligation on non-accrued status;
    (b) the institution recognises a specific credit adjustment resulting from a significant perceived decline 
    in credit quality subsequent to the institution taking on the exposure;
    (c) the institution sells the credit obligation at a material credit-related economic loss;
    (d) the institution consents to a distressed restructuring of the credit obligation where this is likely 
    to result in a diminished financial obligation caused by the material forgiveness, or postponement, of 
    principal, interest or, where relevant fees. This includes, in the case of equity exposures assessed under 
    a PD/LGD Approach, distressed restructuring of the equity itself;
    (e) the institution has filed for the obligor's bankruptcy or a similar order in respect of an obligor's 
    credit obligation to the institution, the parent undertaking or any of its subsidiaries;
    (f) the obligor has sought or has been placed in bankruptcy or similar protection where this would avoid 
    or delay repayment of a credit obligation to the institution, the parent undertaking or any of its subsidiaries.

    4. Institutions that use external data that is not itself consistent with the definition of default laid 
    down in paragraph 1, shall make appropriate adjustments to achieve broad equivalence with the definition of default.

    5. If the institution considers that a previously defaulted exposure is such that no trigger of default 
    continues to apply, the institution shall rate the obligor or facility as they would for a non-defaulted exposure. 
    Where the definition of default is subsequently triggered, another default would be deemed to have occurred.

    6. EBA shall develop draft regulatory technical standards to specify the conditions according to which a 
    competent authority shall set the threshold referred to in paragraph 2(d).

    7. EBA shall issue guidelines on the application of this Article. Those guidelines shall be adopted in accordance 
    with Article 16 of Regulation (EU) No 1093/2010.

    ==========================
    Source 2 > EBA DoD Guidelines > Criteria for the return to a nondefaulted status > Minimum conditions for reclassification 
    to a non-defaulted status

    71. For the purposes of the application of Article 178(5) of Regulation (EU) 575/2013, except for
    situations referred to in paragraph 72, institutions should apply all of the following:
    (a) consider that no trigger of default continues to apply to a previously defaulted
    exposure, where at least 3 months have passed since the moment that the conditions
    referred to in Articles 178(1)(b) and 178(3) of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 cease to
    be met;
    (b) take into account the behaviour of the obligor during the period referred to in point (a);
    (c) take into account the financial situation of the obligor during the period referred to in
    point (a);
    (d) after the period referred to in point (a), perform an assessment, and, where the
    institution still finds that the obligor is unlikely to pay its obligations in full without
    recourse to realising security, the exposures should continue to be classified as
    defaulted until the institution is satisfied that the improvement of the credit quality is
    factual and permanent;
    (e) the conditions referred to in points (a) to (d) should be met also with regard to new
    exposures to the obligor, in particular where the previous defaulted exposures to this
    obligor were sold or written off.
    Institutions may apply the period referred to in point (a) to all exposures or apply different
    periods for different types of exposures.
    
    72. For the purposes of the application of Article 178(5) of Regulation (EU) 575/2013, and where
    distressed restructuring according to paragraph 49 of these guidelines applies to a defaulted
    exposure, regardless of whether such restructuring was carried out before or after the
    identification of default, institutions should consider that no trigger of default continues to
    apply to a previously defaulted exposure, where at least 1 year has passed from the latest
    between one of the following events:
    (a) the moment of extending the restructuring measures;
    (b) the moment when the exposure has been classified as defaulted;
    (c) the end of the grace period included in the restructuring arrangements. 
  answer: |
    Minimum conditions for reclassification of a defaulted exposure or obligor to a
    non-defaulted status, for the purposes of the application of Article 178(5) of
    Regulation (EU) 575/2013 (CRR), are specified in the Guidelines on the
    application of the definition of default under Article 178 of Regulation (EU)
    No 575/2013 (EBA/GL/2016/07). Except for situations referred to in paragraph 72 of said
    Guidelines (distressed restructuring on a defaulted exposure is subject to a probation
    period of at least one year – see also Q&A 4867), all conditions from paragraph 71 of such
    Guidelines should be satisfied for the reclassification of a defaulted exposure or obligor to
    a non-defaulted status. As no trigger of default should continue to apply during a 3-months
    minimum probation period in accordance with point (a) of paragraph 71 of the
    Guidelines, no indication of unlikeliness to pay should be met in accordance
    with Article 178(1)(a) CRR and no material amount should be past due in
    accordance with point (b) of Article 178(1) CRR during this period. Furthermore, as part of the
    assessment required by point (d) (d) of paragraph 71 of the Guidelines, point (b) of that
    paragraph required that the institution takes into account the behavior of the obligor
    during this probation period before reclassifying a defaulted exposure to
    non-defaulted status, and thus the institution should consider any past due
    amount during this period in the analysis of the behavior of the obligor.

  subject_matter: Obligor level
  question: |
    When applying the default at obligor level for retail, should a credit
    institution always consider a specific set of individual obligors that have a
    joint obligation towards an institution as a different obligor (the unit of
    default takes into consideration the JCO)?
    Or is this to be applied only for the materiality threshold?
  background: |
    Paragraph 104 of EBA/GL/2016/07 (Guidelines on the application of the
    definition of default under Article 178 CRR) stipulates: "A joint obligor, i.e. a
    specific set of individual obligors that have a joint obligation towards an
    institution, should be treated as a different obligor from each of the
    individual obligors."
    It is unclear whether - when we apply the default at obligor level for retail -
    we should always consider specific set of individual obligors that have a joint
    obligation towards an institution as a different obligor (the unit of default
    takes into consideration the JCO) or whether this is to be applied only for the
    materiality threshold.
    It can be argued that this is stipulated in the Background and rationale
    (paparaph 2.7.3, page 14) : "for the purpose of application of the materiality
    threshold a joint obligor, i.e. a specific set of individual obligors that commit
    to a joint exposure, should be treated as a different, separate obligor".
    This is to understand if the level of application of the default in case of joint
    credit obligation.
    For example, if we have Mister A and Miss B that are sharing a credit
    obligation and that have also credit alones, it is unclear if we have to
    consider 3 units: Mister A, Miss B and the couple, or only 2 units: Mister A
    and Miss B.
    More specifically, we believe there is a need to define the notion of obligor;
    and also to precise the context of the paragraph 104.
    In particular, the bankruptcy trigger (paragraph 56 of the Guidelines) is
    identified at the Legal person level and does not take into consideration this
    notion of separate set of obligors. Then, if the rules describes in paragraph
    104 apply to everything, it is unclear how to handle the default at Legal
    person level. When considering paragraph 97, in case of JCO and only one
    Legal Person is in bankruptcy, if the other Legal Person has no difficulties,
    there would be no reason to identify it in default.
    Additionally, according to Article 1(4) of Commission Delegated Regulation
    (EU) No 1152/2014 it can be argued that the obligor is “the natural or legal
    person, who is the institution’s counterparty to a general credit exposure or
    the issuer of a financial instrument not included in the trading book or the
    counterparty to a non-trading book exposure”, but there is no explicit
    definition either in CRR or from the EBA.
    It should be noted that, it is not an issue to apply the materiality threshold
    for the default at the Legal Person level (all the Legal person that owned a
    group of obligation breaching the threshold should be considered and that
    will be consistent with the end of the paragraph 104).
    The application of the paragraph 104 to everything could be also
    inconsistent with paragraph 96, according to which “Institutions should
    consider a joint credit obligation as an exposure to two or more obligors that
    are equally responsible for the repayment of the credit obligation” in the
    sense that if the bank has only shared account on Legal Person A and Legal
    Person B (that happens on Retail- Person individuals), then only one obligor
    will be considered and not “two or more”. So we will get Join Credit
    obligation linked to one “obligor”.
  context: |
    Paragraph 104 of EBA/GL/2016/07 >>>
    A joint obligor, i.e. a specific set of individual obligors that have a joint obligation towards
    an institution, should be treated as a different obligor from each of the individual obligors. In
    the case the delay in payment occurs on a joint credit obligation, the materiality of such delay
    should be assessed by applying the materiality threshold referred to in point (d) of Article
    178(2) of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 to all joint credit obligations granted to this specific
    set of obligors. For this purpose the individual exposures to obligors participating in a joint
    credit obligation or to any other subsets of such obligors should not be taken into account.
    However, where the materiality threshold for a joint obligor calculated in this way is
    breached, all joint credit obligations of this set of obligors and all individual exposures to the
    obligors participating in a joint credit obligation should be considered defaulted unless any of
    the conditions specified in paragraph 97 is met.

    =========
    Paragraph 97 of EBA/GL/2016/07 >>>
    Where the conditions of points (a) or (b) or both of Article 178(1) of Regulation (EU) No
    575/2013 are met with regard to a joint credit obligation of two or more obligors, institutions
    should consider all other joint credit obligations of the same set of obligors and all individual
    exposures to those obligors as defaulted, unless they can justify that the recognition of
    default on individual exposures is not appropriate because at least one of the following
    conditions apply:
    (a) the delay in payment of a joint credit obligation results from a dispute between the
    individual obligors participating in the joint credit obligation that has been introduced
    to a court or another formal procedure performed by a dedicated external body that
    results in a binding ruling in accordance with the applicable legal framework in the
    relevant jurisdiction, and there is no concern about the financial situation of the
    individual obligors;
    (b) a joint credit obligation is an immaterial part of the total obligations of an individual
    obligor.

    ========
    Paragraph 99 of EBA/GL/2016/07 >>>
    Where the conditions of points (a) or (b) or both of Article 178(1) of Regulation (EU) No
    575/2013 are met with regard to the credit obligation of an individual obligor, the contagious
    effect of this default should not automatically spread to any joint credit obligations of that
    obligor; nevertheless, institutions should assess such joint credit obligations for possible
    indications of unlikeliness to pay related with the default of one of the obligors. In any case,
    where all individual obligors have a defaulted status, their joint credit obligation should
    automatically also be considered defaulted.

    Source 1: CRR Article 178 > Default of an obligor

    1. A default shall be considered to have occurred with regard to a particular obligor when either or 
    both of the following have taken place:
    (a) the institution considers that the obligor is unlikely to pay its credit obligations to the institution, 
    the parent undertaking or any of its subsidiaries in full, without recourse by the institution to actions 
    such as realising security;
    (b) the obligor is past due more than 90 days on any material credit obligation to the institution, the 
    parent undertaking or any of its subsidiaries. Competent authorities may replace the 90 days with 180 days 
    for exposures secured by residential or SME commercial real estate in the retail exposure class, as well as 
    exposures to public sector entities). The 180 days shall not apply for the purposes of Article 127.

    In the case of retail exposures, institutions may apply the definition of default laid down in points (a) 
    and (b) of the first subparagraph at the level of an individual credit facility rather than in relation to 
    the total obligations of a borrower.

    2. The following shall apply for the purposes of point (b) of paragraph 1:
    (a) for overdrafts, days past due commence once an obligor has breached an advised limit, has been advised 
    a limit smaller than current outstandings, or has drawn credit without authorisation and the underlying 
    amount is material;
    (b) for the purposes of point (a), an advised limit comprises any credit limit determined by the institution 
    and about which the obligor has been informed by the institution;
    (c) days past due for credit cards commence on the minimum payment due date;
    (d) materiality of a credit obligation past due shall be assessed against a threshold, defined by the 
    competent authorities. This threshold shall reflect a level of risk that the competent authority considers 
    to be reasonable;
    (e) institutions shall have documented policies in respect of the counting of days past due, in particular 
    in respect of the re-ageing of the facilities and the granting of extensions, amendments or deferrals, 
    renewals, and netting of existing accounts. These policies shall be applied consistently over time, and 
    shall be in line with the internal risk management and decision processes of the institution.

    3. For the purpose of point (a) of paragraph 1, elements to be taken as indications of unlikeliness to 
    pay shall include the following:
    (a) the institution puts the credit obligation on non-accrued status;
    (b) the institution recognises a specific credit adjustment resulting from a significant perceived decline 
    in credit quality subsequent to the institution taking on the exposure;
    (c) the institution sells the credit obligation at a material credit-related economic loss;
    (d) the institution consents to a distressed restructuring of the credit obligation where this is likely 
    to result in a diminished financial obligation caused by the material forgiveness, or postponement, of 
    principal, interest or, where relevant fees. This includes, in the case of equity exposures assessed under 
    a PD/LGD Approach, distressed restructuring of the equity itself;
    (e) the institution has filed for the obligor's bankruptcy or a similar order in respect of an obligor's 
    credit obligation to the institution, the parent undertaking or any of its subsidiaries;
    (f) the obligor has sought or has been placed in bankruptcy or similar protection where this would avoid

    7. EBA shall issue guidelines on the application of this Article. Those guidelines shall be adopted in accordance 
    with Article 16 of Regulation (EU) No 1093/2010.

  answer: |
    The first sentence of paragraph 104 of the Guidelines on the application of
    the definition of default under Article 178 of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013
    (EBA/GL/2016/07) states: “A joint obligor, i.e. a specific set of individual
    obligors that have a joint obligation towards an institution, should be treated
    as a different obligor from each of the individual obligors.” This sentence is
    not limited to materiality of credit obligations past due for Article 178(1)(b)
    CRR and the materiality threshold according to Article 178(2)(d) CRR, thus
    this sentence also applies to unlikeliness to pay according to Article 178(1)(a)
    CRR.
    That the specific treatment of joint obligors is not limited to the materiality
    threshold but also applies for unlikeliness to pay is already made clear by
    paragraph 97 of EBA/GL/2016/07, which requires extending the default
    classification of individual  exposures to the joint obligors not only arising
    from the material past due criterion according to point (b) but explicitly also
    from the unlikeliness-to-pay criterion according to point (a) of Article 178(1)
     CRR. Paragraph 99 of said Guidelines additionally clarifies that where the
    conditions of points (a) or (b) or both of Article 178(1) CRR are met with
    regard to the credit obligation of an individual obligor, the contagious
    effect of this default should not automatically spread to any joint credit
    obligations of that obligor but nevertheless, institutions should assess such
    joint credit obligations for possible indications of unlikeliness to pay related
    with the default of one of the obligors.

    Leasing - Contagion du défaut aux paiements minimaux - Default contagion
    for minimum payments
  question: |
    Under the standardised method, in the context of equipment leasing (vehicle
    lease), if more than three months of the lease are unpaid, must the default
    definition be applied to these due and unpaid payments of the lease only, or
    is it essential that a default contagion be applied to all projected lease
    payments which are not yet due (minimum payments provided for in the
    lease: see Article 134(7) CRR)?
  background: |
    Example:
    Monthly lease payment = EUR 100
    Total payments for the duration of the lease: EUR 100 x 48 months = EUR 4800
    (minimum payments expected from the start of the lease}
    Lease payments made over 8 months = EUR 800
    Lease payments still due after 8 months: EUR 4000
    Unpaid lease payments for 4 months = EUR 400 => in default
    Lease payments not due but expected under the lease (minimum remaining
    payments due) = EUR 3600 => are they defined in default, by contagion?
    Or are they to be kept as performing assets as they have not fallen due yet?
    In COREP reporting, should the total amount of the exposure in default be
    EUR 400 (as this amount corresponds to more than 3 due and unpaid
    monthly lease payments) or EUR 4000 (the total minimum payments due
    and not yet due).

    CRR Article 134 >>>

    1.   Tangible assets within the meaning of Article 4(10) of Directive 86/635/EEC shall be assigned a risk weight of 100 %.

    2.   Prepayments and accrued income for which an institution is unable to determine the counterparty in accordance with 
    Directive 86/635/EEC, shall be assigned a risk weight of 100 %.
    
    3.   Cash items in the process of collection shall be assigned a 20 % risk weight. Cash in hand and equivalent cash items 
    shall be assigned a 0 % risk weight.
    
    4.   Gold bullion held in own vaults or on an allocated basis to the extent backed by bullion liabilities shall be assigned 
    a 0 % risk weight.
    
    5.   In the case of asset sale and repurchase agreements and outright forward purchases, the risk weight shall be that assigned 
    to the assets in question and not to the counterparties to the transactions.
    
    6.   Where an institution provides credit protection for a number of exposures under terms that the nth 
    default among the exposures shall trigger payment and that this credit event shall terminate the contract, 
    and where the product has an external credit assessment from an ECAI, the risk weights prescribed in Chapter 5 
    shall be assigned. If the product is not rated by an ECAI, the risk weights of the exposures included in the 
    basket will be aggregated, excluding n-1 exposures, up to a maximum of 1 250 % and multiplied by the nominal 
    amount of the protection provided by the credit derivative to obtain the risk weighted asset amount. 
    The n-1 exposures to be excluded from the aggregation shall be determined on the basis that they shall 
    include those exposures each of which produces a lower risk-weighted exposure amount than the risk-weighted 
    exposure amount of any of the exposures included in the aggregation.
    
    7.   The exposure value for leases shall be the discounted minimum lease payments. Minimum lease payments are 
    the payments over the lease term that the lessee is or can be required to make and any bargain option the 
    exercise of which is reasonably certain. A party other than the lessee may be required to make a payment 
    related to the residual value of a leased property and that payment obligation fulfils the set of conditions 
    in Article 201 regarding the eligibility of protection providers as well as the requirements for recognising 
    other types of guarantees provided in Articles 213 to 215, that payment obligation may be taken into account 
    as unfunded credit protection under Chapter 4. These exposures shall be assigned to the relevant exposure 
    class in accordance with Article 112. When the exposure is a residual value of leased assets, the risk weighted 
    exposure amounts shall be calculated as follows: 1/t * 100 % * residual value, where t is the greater of 1 and the nearest 
    number of whole years of the lease remaining.

    Source 1: CRR Article 178 > Default of an obligor

    1. A default shall be considered to have occurred with regard to a particular obligor when either or 
    both of the following have taken place:
    (a) the institution considers that the obligor is unlikely to pay its credit obligations to the institution, 
    the parent undertaking or any of its subsidiaries in full, without recourse by the institution to actions 
    such as realising security;
    (b) the obligor is past due more than 90 days on any material credit obligation to the institution, the 
    parent undertaking or any of its subsidiaries. Competent authorities may replace the 90 days with 180 days 
    for exposures secured by residential or SME commercial real estate in the retail exposure class, as well as 
    exposures to public sector entities). The 180 days shall not apply for the purposes of Article 127.

    In the case of retail exposures, institutions may apply the definition of default laid down in points (a) 
    and (b) of the first subparagraph at the level of an individual credit facility rather than in relation to 
    the total obligations of a borrower.

    2. The following shall apply for the purposes of point (b) of paragraph 1:
    (a) for overdrafts, days past due commence once an obligor has breached an advised limit, has been advised 
    a limit smaller than current outstandings, or has drawn credit without authorisation and the underlying 
    amount is material;
    (b) for the purposes of point (a), an advised limit comprises any credit limit determined by the institution 
    and about which the obligor has been informed by the institution;
    (c) days past due for credit cards commence on the minimum payment due date;
    (d) materiality of a credit obligation past due shall be assessed against a threshold, defined by the 
    competent authorities. This threshold shall reflect a level of risk that the competent authority considers 
    to be reasonable;
    (e) institutions shall have documented policies in respect of the counting of days past due, in particular 
    in respect of the re-ageing of the facilities and the granting of extensions, amendments or deferrals, 
    renewals, and netting of existing accounts. These policies shall be applied consistently over time, and 
    shall be in line with the internal risk management and decision processes of the institution.

    3. For the purpose of point (a) of paragraph 1, elements to be taken as indications of unlikeliness to 
    pay shall include the following:
    (a) the institution puts the credit obligation on non-accrued status;
    (b) the institution recognises a specific credit adjustment resulting from a significant perceived decline 
    in credit quality subsequent to the institution taking on the exposure;
    (c) the institution sells the credit obligation at a material credit-related economic loss;
    (d) the institution consents to a distressed restructuring of the credit obligation where this is likely 
    to result in a diminished financial obligation caused by the material forgiveness, or postponement, of 
    principal, interest or, where relevant fees. This includes, in the case of equity exposures assessed under 
    a PD/LGD Approach, distressed restructuring of the equity itself;
    (e) the institution has filed for the obligor's bankruptcy or a similar order in respect of an obligor's 
    credit obligation to the institution, the parent undertaking or any of its subsidiaries;
    (f) the obligor has sought or has been placed in bankruptcy or similar protection where this would avoid 
    or delay repayment of a credit obligation to the institution, the parent undertaking or any of its subsidiaries.

    4. Institutions that use external data that is not itself consistent with the definition of default laid 
    down in paragraph 1, shall make appropriate adjustments to achieve broad equivalence with the definition of default.

    5. If the institution considers that a previously defaulted exposure is such that no trigger of default 
    continues to apply, the institution shall rate the obligor or facility as they would for a non-defaulted exposure. 
    Where the definition of default is subsequently triggered, another default would be deemed to have occurred.

    6. EBA shall develop draft regulatory technical standards to specify the conditions according to which a 
    competent authority shall set the threshold referred to in paragraph 2(d).

    7. EBA shall issue guidelines on the application of this Article. Those guidelines shall be adopted in accordance 
    with Article 16 of Regulation (EU) No 1093/2010.
    
  answer: |
    In accordance with Article 178(1)( b) of Regulation (EU) No. 575/2013
    (“CRR”), “a default shall be considered to have occurred with regard to a
    particular obligor when”, in particular, “the obligor is more than 90 days
    past due on any material credit obligation to the institution, the parent
    undertaking or any of its subsidiaries.”
    Unless the institution applies the definition of default at the level of an
    individual credit facility, as provided for by the second subparagraph of the
    same Article and paragraph to the respective exposures, it follows that in
    case of a default of the obligor in accordance with Article 178(1)(b) CRR all
    exposures towards that particular obligor shall be classified in default status.
    In case the definition of default is applied at the level of an individual credit
    facility as in accordance with Article 134(7) CRR, “the exposure value for
    leases shall be the discounted minimum lease payments”, irrespective of
    some lease payments being still not due, the exposure related to a given
    lease contract with any material payments past due for more than three
    months, or any other indication of unlikeliness to pay, is classified as in
    default.

  subject_matter: Absolute materiality threshold for Retail based on the new RTS
  question: |
    How to apply Article 123(c) CRR to set the absolute component of the
    materiality threshold in the case of transition of exposures to or from Retail.
  background: |
    The question is on the application of Definition of Default and in particular
    on the threshold used for DoD for retail exposures.
    Article 1(4) of RTS 2018/171 on the materiality threshold for credit
    obligations past due under Article 178 of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013
    (CRR) references Article 123 CRR for the definition of retail or institutions
    that apply the Standardised Approach and, hence, the 100 EUR vs 500 EUR
    minimum amount (i.e. absolute component).
    Article 123 CRR lists a number of conditions that must be met in order for an
    exposure to be classified as Retail. Given that according to paragraph (c) the
    classification depends on the total exposure to a group of connected clients,
    it is not clear how this should be applied to set the absolute component of
    the materiality threshold in the case of transition of exposures to or from
    Retail, as defined in Article 123.
    There are cases when it is unclear how to apply the materiality threshold for
    all exposures, at any point in time, in accordance with the classification of an
    obligor as retail or as corporate, in particular when the exposures are to a
    group of connected clients. For example:
    1: an exposure of 500,000 Euro to a natural person, classified as retail on a
    standalone basis, but part of a group of connected clients with an overall
    exposure of over 1 million;
    2: a similar case to example 1, but where the retail client's exposure is
    20,000 Euro and the client has 200 Euro past due, which is 1% and above
    100 EUR;
    3: a similar type of client as above with an exposure of 30,000 Euros fully
    secured by a mortgage
    4: a group of connected clients with a total exposure of 1.5 million Euros, of
    which  700,000 fully and completely secured on residential property
    collateral. One of the clients in this group has an exposure of 20,000 EUR. It
    is unclear whether this exposure would qualify as retail, as the unsecured
    part is below 1 million.  Also, it is unclear what would happen if the collateral
    becomes ineligible.

    for exposures secured by residential or SME commercial real estate in the retail exposure class, as well as 
    exposures to public sector entities). The 180 days shall not apply for the purposes of Article 127.

    In the case of retail exposures, institutions may apply the definition of default laid down in points (a) 
    and (b) of the first subparagraph at the level of an individual credit facility rather than in relation to 
    the total obligations of a borrower.

    2. The following shall apply for the purposes of point (b) of paragraph 1:
    (a) for overdrafts, days past due commence once an obligor has breached an advised limit, has been advised

    a PD/LGD Approach, distressed restructuring of the equity itself;
    (e) the institution has filed for the obligor's bankruptcy or a similar order in respect of an obligor's 
    credit obligation to the institution, the parent undertaking or any of its subsidiaries;

    Paragraph 86 of EBA/GL/2016/07 >>>
    According to the second sub-paragraph of Article 178(1) of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013, in
    the case of retail exposures, institutions may apply the definition of default at the level of an
    individual credit facility rather than in relation to the total obligations of a borrower.
    Therefore, institutions that use the IRB Approach, in particular, may apply the definition of
    default at the level of the individual facility for retail exposures as defined in Article 147(5) of
    Regulation (EU) 575/2013. Institutions that use the Standardised Approach, instead may apply
    the definition of default at the level of an individual credit facility for all exposures that meet
    the criteria specified in Article 123 of Regulation (EU) 575/2013, even where some of those
    exposures have been assigned to a different exposure class for the purpose of assigning a risk
    weight, such as exposures secured by mortgages on immovable property. 

    =========
    Paragraph 88 of EBA/GL/2016/07 >>>
    Institutions may apply the definition of default at the level of an obligor for some types of
    retail exposures and at the level of a credit facility for others, where this is well justified by
    internal risk management practices, for instance due to a different business model of a
    subsidiary, and where there is evidence that the number of situations where the same clients
    are subject to different definitions of default at different levels of application is kept to a strict
    minimum.
        
  answer: |
    For all past-due exposures, at any point in time, the materiality threshold
    should be applied in accordance with the current classification of an obligor
    as retail or as non-retail.
    Where a client is part of a group of connected clients, the total amount owed
    for the purpose of classification as retail under Article 123(c) of Regulation
    (EU) No 575/2013 as amended by Regulation (EU) 2019/876 (CRR2) is
    calculated at the level of the group of connected clients . Conversely, the
    materiality threshold for the purpose of the default definition under Articles
    127 and 178 CRR is assessed separately at the level of each individual
    obligor or, where applicable, separately at the level of each individual credit
    facility of such obligors.
    Moreover, pursuant to paragraph 61 of the EBA Guidelines 2016/07 on the
    application of the definition of default under Article 178 of Regulation (EU)
    No 575/2013, when specifying the criteria for unlikeliness to pay, institutions
    should take into consideration the relations within the groups of connected
    clients as defined in Article 4(1)(39) CRR2. In particular, institutions should
    specify in their internal policies when the default of one obligor within the
    group of connected clients has a contagious effect on other entities within
    this group. Such specifications should be in line with the appropriate policies
    for the assignment of exposures to individual obligor to an obligor grade and
    to groups of connected clients in accordance with Article 172(1)(d) CRR2
    and with EBA Guidelines 2017/15 on connected clients. Where such criteria
    have not been specified for a non-standard situation, in the case of default of
    an obligor that is part of a group of connected clients, institutions should
    assess the potential unlikeliness to pay of all other entities within this group
    on a case-by-case basis.
    In addition, as clarified in paragraph 86 and following of the EBA Guidelines
    2016/07 on the application of the definition of default under Article 178 of
    Regulation (EU) No 575/2013, institutions that use the Standardised
    Approach may apply the definition of default at the level of an individual
    credit facility. Institutions that use the Standardised Approach may apply
    this treatment for all exposures that meet the criteria specified in Article 123
    CCR2, even where some of those exposures have been assigned to a different
    exposure class for the purpose of assigning a risk weight, such as exposures
    secured by mortgages on immovable property. The level of application of the
    definition of default should then be consistently used for all retail exposures,
    unless other approach is well justified by internal risk management practices
    (as clarified in paragraph 88 of the EBA Guidelines 2016/07).
    On how to calculate the total amount owed to the institution by an obligor
    and parent undertakings and its subsidiaries under Article 123(c) CRR2 in
    order to determine whether an exposure can be classified as Retail under the
    Standardised Approach, see also Q&A 4012.

  subject_matter: Treatment of joint credit obligations
  question: |
    Do the requirements established in the Guidelines on the application of the
    definition of default under Article 178 of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013
    regarding joint credit obligations, and in particular the requirements 95, 96,
    97, 98, 99, 103, 104 and 105, relate or affect exclusively to retail exposures?
    In that case, could the treatment of joint credit obligations in which the
    obligors are classified as Non – Retail differ from the treatment of joint credit
    obligations in which the obligors are classified as Retail?
    In addition, and, as per this purpose, what should be the treatment of joint
    credit obligations shared by retail and non-retail obligors?
  background: |
    Chapter 9 of the Guidelines on the application of the definition of default
    under Article 178 of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 sets the specific
    requirements regarding the treatment of joint credit obligations where an
    institution decides to apply the definition of default at the obligor level for
    retail exposures. Nevertheless, these Guidelines don’t include any specific
    requirements regarding the treatment of joint credit obligations for non-
    retail exposures.
    In this context, the treatment of joint credit obligations for non-retail
    exposures, or even when the joint credit obligation is shared among retail
    obligor(s) and non-retail obligor(s), does not seem to be specifically defined.
  context: |
    Paragraph 95 of EBA/GL/2016/07 >>>
    Application of the definition of default for retail exposures at the obligor level
    The application of the definition of default for retail exposures at the obligor level implies
    that, where any credit obligation of the obligor meets the conditions of points (a) or (b) or
    both of Article 178(1) of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013, then all exposures to that obligor
    should be considered defaulted. Institutions that decide to apply the definition of default for
    retail exposures at the obligor level should specify detailed rules for the treatment of joint
    credit obligations and default contagion between exposures in their internal policies and
    procedures.

    ======
    Paragraph 58 of EBA/GL/2016/07 >>>
    Institutions should specify in their internal policies and procedures other additional
    indications of unlikeliness to pay of an obligor, besides those specified in Article 178(3) of
    Regulation (EU) No 575/2013. Those additional indications should be specified per type of
    exposures, as defined in point (2) of Article 142(1) of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013, reflecting
    their specificities, and they should be specified for all business lines, legal entities or
    geographical locations. The occurrence of an additional indication of unlikeliness to pay
    should either result in an automatic reclassification to defaulted exposures or trigger a caseby-case 
    assessment and may include indications based on internal or external information.
    
  answer: |
    Paragraphs 95 and following of the EBA guidelines on the definition of
    default only prescribe the treatment institutions should apply to a joint credit
    obligation classified as retail exposure. Therefore it should be up to
    institutions to specify the treatment of joint credit obligations other than
    retail and for default contagion between exposures in their internal policies
    and procedures, as part of the ‘other indications of unlikeliness to pay’, as
    mentioned in section 5 of the EBA guidelines on the definition of default. In
    particular, where one or all entities involved in the joint obligation is/are not
    classified as retail exposures, the treatment provided for in chapter 9 of the
    aforementioned GLs should be applied for the retail entities and may also be
    applied for the non-retail entities.
