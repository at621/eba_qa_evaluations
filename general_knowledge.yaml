DefinitionOfDefaultGuidelines: |
  The guidelines provide a common framework for applying the definition of default (DoD) across financial institutions in the EU. 
  These guidelines aim to enhance consistency, promote a level playing field, and ensure comparability of risk parameters and 
  capital requirements under the Internal Ratings Based (IRB) and Standardised Approaches.

  A. Purpose:
  The guidelines clarify how to identify default events to avoid inconsistencies that impact comparability. 
  Harmonization ensures uniform practices, and a phase-in period is included to ease the implementation for institutions using the IRB approach.

  B. Vocabulary:
  - "Obligor: The party responsible for repaying a debt."
  - "Exposure: The financial institution's risk associated with a specific obligor."
  - "Default: A situation where the obligor is unlikely to fully repay obligations without lender actions such as realizing collateral."
  - "Materiality Threshold: The minimum overdue amount or percentage of obligations that triggers default. It includes absolute 
  (minimum amount overdue) and relative (percentage of total obligations) components."
  - "Distressed Restructuring: Modifications to credit agreements reducing borrower obligations due to financial difficulties."
  - "Probation Period: The period during which a defaulted obligor must demonstrate satisfactory repayment to return to non-defaulted status."

  C. Level of Application:
  - For corporate exposures, default must be applied at the obligor level, meaning all obligations of a defaulted obligor are considered defaulted.
  - For retail exposures, default can be applied at the facility level (assessing individual facilities) or the obligor level 
  (default in one exposure applies to all). Institutions may use different applications for retail exposure types but 
  should maintain consistency within legal entities and jurisdictions.

  D. Default Triggers:
  Two main conditions trigger default:
  1. Days Past Due: Obligations overdue by more than 90 days, breaching the materiality threshold.
  2. Unlikeliness to Pay: Situations where repayment in full is unlikely without lender action, such as:
     - Interest no longer recognized due to credit quality issues.
     - Specific credit risk adjustments indicating a significant decline in credit quality.
     - Sale of obligations resulting in material economic loss.
     - Restructuring that diminishes financial obligations.
     - Bankruptcy or similar protection filed by the obligor.
  
  Additional indications of unlikeliness to pay include internal signals, such as lost income or rising leverage, and external factors, 
  like sector crises or delays with other creditors.

  E. Returning to Non-Defaulted Status:
  Obligors can return to non-defaulted status after repaying overdue amounts, resolving triggers, and meeting a satisfactory 
  probation period (minimum 3 months for most cases and 1 year for distressed restructuring).

  F. Use of External Data:
  Institutions using external data for risk estimation must ensure it aligns with their internal default definition. 
  Discrepancies must be adjusted or justified as negligible; otherwise, a conservative margin should be applied.

  H. Documentation Requirements:
  Institutions must document their default identification processes, criteria for reclassification, and maintain a 
  history of default definitions. Both automatic and manual mechanisms should be described.

  I. Internal Governance:
  The management body or senior committees must approve the institution's definition of default. 
  It should be consistently applied for own funds requirements and risk management purposes, and processes should be regularly audited.
